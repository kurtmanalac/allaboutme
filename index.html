			<h1>Favorite CMSC subject so far and why</h1>
			<p>
				My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 128.  It gave me a glimpse on how the industry operates as well as the work cycle they follow.  Learning how to work with my fellow team members and assigning the specific tasks to them, since I was the Project Manager, helped me ease into my internship.

			<h1>Favorite GE so far and why</h1>
			<p>
				When I took SPCM 1 during A.Y. 2017-2018 midyear, I never realized it would be the last of its kind, and the most memorable one.  The professor was engaging, technical, and most of all, hilarious.  Despite lasting for 6 weeks, I got close to my classmates and remain close even now.

			<h1>Favorite PL and why</h1>
			<p>
				Despite having learned multiple different programming languages, Python, C, Java, R, Assembly, etc., my favorite is still C.  I consider it the basis of all programming languages since it is a powerful language with many capabilities.  It is also similar to C++, its Object Oriented Programming Language counterpart, making it easy to transition between the two.
